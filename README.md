Hi Viewers,

My name is Matt. I like to play trombone and am currently in college for Computer Science and Mathematics.
I also have a hobby of analyzing movies and fixing certain ones in particular.

While not having an internship this semester, I will be researching more languages and doing projects to expand my portfolio this summer.
